# alignment_concatenator
A biopython script to concatenate different nexus files for phylogenomics. You need to have all the alignments that are to be concatenated in .nex (nexus) format. Put them in a same folder and call this script (from path or from that same folder). It outputs the concatenated alignment with a nexus block at the end showing the details of concatenation.
